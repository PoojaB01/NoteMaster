## Description:

- Taking good notes in class is an integral part of academic success in college. Actively taking
notes during class sessions can help you focus and better understand the main concepts. 
-Taking notes on both synchronous and asynchronous material can help students better remember what they hear and see. 
- Efficient and concise notes can also save time, energy, and confusion for a
student. 
- There is no right format to use when taking notes. Preferably, many different structures and styles can be used to take quality notes. 
- The following way a student can do the note-taking:
  1. Writing outline to organize the lecture by main points, allowing room for examples and details.
  2. Using a flowchart/concept map to represent the lecture content visually
  3. Organizing notes from lectures with a substantial amount of facts through dividing key topics into columns and recording facts underneath.
  4. Quickly covering essential details and information 
  5. Design and develop software that can be useful for a student while taking class notes.
  6. Keeping sections for the date, essential question, topic, notes, questions, and a summary.
using flow charts and concept maps.

## Software development life cycle:

- We have performed the following activities in our software development life cycle:
  - [Functional Requirements Analysis](SDLC/Software%20Requirement%20Specification/functional_requirements.pdf)
  - [Non-Functional Requirements Analysis](SDLC/Software%20Requirement%20Specification/non_functional_requirements.pdf)
  - [Design Document](SDLC/Design%20Documents/design_document.pdf)
  - [Design Justification](SDLC/Design%20Documents/design_justification.pdf)
  - [Usability Study](/SDLC/Design%20Documents/usability_document.pdf)
  - [Medium Fidelity Prototype](/SDLC/Prototype/prototype.pdf)  
  - [Prototype Evaluation](/SDLC/Prototype/prototype_evaluation.pdf)
